# To Do

## Features / changes / updates / improvements etc. to the current ones
### NOTE: these todos are sorted from "more important" to "less important"
- [ ] Put **ppi** to the PyPI. The name **ppi** is actually taken there already,
  so the name needs to be changed to something else. (Maybe create a fork off of
  **ppi** as the "new" project and come up with a name that's not already
  reserved, I don't know...)

- [ ] Implement verbose/debug functionality with corresponding flag

- [x] Generate MANIFEST.in when generating project

- [ ] When generating man pages, write AUTHOR section there (this is actually
  done already by **pandoc**. However, if the man-pages ought to be created
  without using **pandoc**, then this would be relevant)

- [ ] Utilize Github's / Gitea's API (or both)

## Refactoring

## Other stuff
- [ ] Attach a licence
