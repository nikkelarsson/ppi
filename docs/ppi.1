ppi \[en] Python project initializer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
None
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
With \f[B]ppi\f[R], one can create a new Python project, that will be
initialized with basic things, like readme- and other basic files, that
one would almost without a doubt create everytime anyway.
\f[B]ppi\f[R] makes starting a new project more stress-free as one
doesn\[cq]t each and every time have to go and create files manually.
.SH AUTHORS
Niklas Larsson.
