# NAME
ppi â€“ Python project initializer.

# SYNOPSIS
None

# DESCRIPTION
With **ppi**, one can create a new Python project, that will be initialized with
basic things, like readme- and other basic files, that one would almost without
a doubt create everytime anyway. **ppi** makes starting a new project more
stress-free as one doesn't each and every time have to go and create files
manually.
